  > World models are the basis for the ability to predict what might happen next, which is fundamentally important for autonomous driving. They can act as a learned simulator, or a mental ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù thought experiment for model-based reinforcement learning (RL) or planning. By incorporating world models into our driving models, we can enable them to understand human decisions better and ultimately generalise to more real-world situations.
