## Workshop & Challenge

- [`CVPR 2024 Workshop & Challenge | OpenDriveLab`](https://opendrivelab.com/challenge2024/#predictive_world_model) Track #4: Predictive World Model.
  > Serving as an abstract spatio-temporal representation of reality, the world model can predict future states based on the current state. The learning process of world models has the potential to elevate a pre-trained foundation model to the next level. Given vision-only inputs, the neural network outputs point clouds in the future to testify its predictive capability of the world.
  
- [`CVPR 2023 Workshop on Autonomous Driving`](https://cvpr2023.wad.vision/) CHALLENGE 3: ARGOVERSE CHALLENGES, [3D Occupancy Forecasting](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1977/overview) using the [Argoverse 2 Sensor Dataset](https://www.argoverse.org/av2.html#sensor-link). Predict the spacetime occupancy of the world for the next 3 seconds.

  > World models are the basis for the ability to predict what might happen next, which is fundamentally important for autonomous driving. They can act as a learned simulator, or a mental ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù thought experiment for model-based reinforcement learning (RL) or planning. By incorporating world models into our driving models, we can enable them to understand human decisions better and ultimately generalise to more real-world situations.
